# Project : LAB 1

* Feature 1: calculate the average price per brand, average price per category
* Feature 2: for each unique year, list the count of SKUs and print out the SKUs as a list i.e., 2000 (3): 111, 211, 311 where it is a new line per year 
The computed values are displayed in a report ```output.txt```. The original data also is displayed in the output file.
